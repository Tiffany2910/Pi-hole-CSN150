# Pi-hole-CSN150
Installing a pi-hole to block unnecessary ads and pop ups. According to google, a Pi-hole is a Linux network level advertisement and internet tracker blocking application. It can also be used as a DHCP server on a private network. You will need the following:
Raspberry Pi, micro sd card, micro sd card reader, usb cable or usb c cable depending on your computer/device.
Next you have to go to https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/. Download the Raspberry Pi imager according to your OS. Once it has downloaded, insert you mircro sd card into your card reader.
Then insert your card reader into your computers' usb slot. Click on the Raspberry pi imager and select "Choose OS". Then select "Raspberry Pi (other)" and then select "Raspberry Pi OS Lite 32- bit".
After choosing the OS, click on "Storage" and make sure you select the SD card you inserted earlier. Look on the bottom right of the Pi imager. There will be a settings wheel. 
Click on it, name your respberry pi and enable SSH. Then give it a username and password. Make sure to write down your information for future reference. When your finished, click "write" and let the Pi imager load. This is where I came to a problem. After I wrote on the SD card I didnt remember what steps to take next.
I am using a Mac and was unable to find a way to continue on it. Also the Raspberry Pi was lit red instead of steady green. 
What I learned from this process is when installing anything there can always be a problem that you have to troubleshoot. Especially dealing with technology, anything can happen. Trouble shooting can be stressful but in the end you can learn different ways to find the solution to the problem.
